My original version of Battleship.

Run 'ruby battleship.rb' to play the game.

If you want to change whether Player 1 or Player 2 build ships automatically or manually, 
or shoot automatically or manually, edit lines 35-36 of lib/setup.rb

Edit lines 23-28 of lib/setup.rb if you want to change the ships you use.

As you can see: I didn't do the best job of organizing this code in a sensible readable way.
It was my first time dealing with a project of this scale. It gets a lot clearer in subsequent.

However, it all works, I learned a lot, and I did some nice stuff, given my skill level.
